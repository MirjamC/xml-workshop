# # 1. Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks
# This lesson will give a short introduction on how to work with Notebooks in combination with Python. 
# It consists of explanation followed by pratical exercises. To get the most out of this lesson it is best to manually type the code into your Jupyter Notebook instead of copy-pasting.
# 
# ## Notebooks
# First, lets start up Jupyter and open a Notebook.
# In the taskbar searchbox, type 'jupyter' and open *jupyter notebook*.
# This should open a tab in your browser with the jupyter hub in the installation folder. 
# This folder will act as your home folder for jupyter.
# All Notebooks you make will be stored here unless explicitely saved elsewhere or moved.
# 
# To open a new Python Jupyter Notebook click the **new** button in the topright corner and select **python3** from the drowdown list.
# A new tab should open dispaying your new Notebook, usually called *Untitled*
# 
# Notebooks can be renamed by clicking on the name and typing a different name. It is best to make these names descriptive so they are still recognizable after a while. 
# 
# **To add:** screenshots 
# 
# ## How does a Notebook work?
# 
# A Notebook is not a static page, but an interactive enviroment. Within the blocks (cells) of a Notebook code can be written Ã¡nd executed.
# 
# ### Different cell types
# 
# Notebooks are compromised of different types of cells. 
# The main cell types are *text cells* and *code cells*.
# 
# Text cells are generally used for descriptions and explanations. These cells are inactive and code written in these cells cannot be executed.
# 
# **To add:** screenshot text cell
# 
# The layout is managed through *markdown* (see [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for more information).
# 
# The second main type of cell is the code cell. 
# Code cells are used to write and execute code. In our case Python. When a code cell is run, Python will execute the code in the cell.
# 
# **To add:** screenshot code  cell
# 
# Code cells are easily recognized by the 'In [ ]:' to the left of the cell.
# 
# The type of a cell can be changed by selecting a cell and either going through the menu (Cell/Cell Type/<option>) or by selecting a cell and pressing either **Y** for a code cell or **M** for a text cell.
# 
# **To add:** printscreen menu celltype
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Select a cell in the Notebook and change the type by using the hotkeys or the menu. 
# ```
# 
# ### Running cells
# There are multiple ways to run a cell:
# * By clicking the 'Run' button in the taskbar;
# * By pressing 'shift + enter when the cell is selected (green frame)'
# 	*Note that this will add a new cell below the cell that was run.*
# 
# The moment a cell generates *output* the output is displayed beneath the cell, keeping code and output together.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise 
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[1]:


2*8


# ```{note}
# When the code does not give output after running it, check the cell type!
# ```
# 
# ### Comments
# 
# Comments can be added to a code cell. Comments can be used to describe what a piece of code does, or can be used to tell where values can be changed.

# In[2]:


# This is an example of a comment in a code cell.


# **To Add** screenshot of comment in cell, remove about codecell
# 
# The moment a # is typed in a code cell, everything after it will be regarded as a comment. Lines that have been marked as a comment will **not** be executed by Python when the cell is run.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise 
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell. Does Python return output?
# ```

# In[3]:


#print("The solution to 35+12 is:")
#print(35+12)


# ```{admonition} Solution
# :class: tip, dropdown
# The cell should not return any input as the code is blocked by the #.
# ```
# 
# When the **#** is removed and the cell is run again, Python wil recognize the code and execute it.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Ensure that Python executes the code and run the cell again.
# ```
# 
# ```{admonition} Solution
# :class: tip, dropdown
# Removing the # from the code should enable Python to recognize the code return output when the cell is run
# ```
# 
# ## Python
# 
# Python was developed in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. The purpose of Python was to create a programming language that is both simple to understand and readable. Python works on different platforms such as Windowns, Mac, Linux, etc. It is a very popular programming language in data analysis and data science because of its versatality.
# Python is open source, and can be used for free.
# 
# ### Input and variables
# 
# When using Python there are multiple types of input data, such as lists, numbers, text, and even whole tables.
# We put this input into *variables*. Essentially a container for the data. The name of a variable is up to your own discretion, although there are some [rules and guidlines](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_variable_names.asp). 
# 
# Python remembers which input was loaded into which variable. This means that the variables can be used in the code instead of the data itself.
# 
# It is important to input data correctly, for numbers *no* quotation marks are used, for text quotation marks *must be* used!
# 
# The command *type()* can be used to determine what type of input a variable contains. 
# 
# *int* indicates a variable contains an integer, or whole number.
# *str* indicates a variable contains a string, a piece of text. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[4]:


number = 9
text = "this is a text"


# In[5]:


type(number)


# In[6]:


type(text)


# ```{admonition} Note
# **Important!** If you input a number *with* quotation marks Python will see it as text!
# ```
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise 
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[7]:


number_but_wrong = "9"
type(number_but_wrong)


# As mentioned above it is possible to use previously assigned variables in your code. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
#  Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[8]:


number_1 = 3
number_2 = 6

number_1 + number_2 


# Python simply adds the original numbers as it remembers which input belongs to which variable.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Using Python variables, calculate the sum of "35 + 69" in the cell below. Start with making two variables to assign the numbers *35* and *69* to. Calculate the sum using these variables.
# ```

# In[9]:


# Make a variable for the number 35

# Make a variable for the number 69

# Calculate the sum using the variables


# The plus sign can be used to calculate sums, as you did in the above exercise. However, the plus sign can also be used to stick two different texts together. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[10]:


line_1 = "This is a "
line_2 = "stuck together text"

line_1 + line_2


# As you can see Python adds the text elements together to form a longer sentence. This also works with multiple variables.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Ensure that the four lines below are printed as one sentence in the output.
# ```

# In[11]:


line_1 = "Because of this Notebook "
line_2 = "I now know "
line_3 = "that programming with Python "
line_4 = "is very fun!"


# Now, what about adding text and numbers from variables together?
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[12]:


line_1 = "The amount of abstracts for DHBenelux is: "
amount_1 = 43

line_1 + amount_1


# ```{admonition} Solution
# :class: tip, dropdown
# This gives an error:
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
# Just adding numbers and text does not work. Some extra work needs to be done in order for Python to correctly return output without errors
# ```
# 
# There are multiple options to convince Python to return combinations of numbers and  text:
# - force numbers to text with *str()*
# - *f strings*
# 
# To force Python to interpret a number as text its type can be changed with str(number).
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[ ]:


line_1 = "The amount of abstracts for DHBenelux is: "
amount_1 = 43

line_1 + str(amount_1)


# This also works with multiple variabeles and pieces of text outside of variables.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[ ]:


line_1 = "coffee breaks "
amount_1 = 2
 
"The amount of " + line_1 + "in this workshop is: " + str(amount_1)


# ```{note}
# Notice the space after each of the pieces of text (either in or outside a variable).
# Try removing it to see what happens
# ```
# 
# Another option is the use of *f strings*. This is a way of telling Python where to insert the contents of a variable into a string. 
# 
# The syntax for *f strings* is:

# In[ ]:


f"This is the string we type and {this_is_the_variable}"


# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.
# ```

# In[ ]:


line_1 = "coffee breaks "
amount_1 = 2
 
f"The amount of {line_1} in this workshop is: {amount_1}"


# ### Functions
# 
# When you program in Python you will make use of functions. The *str()* code used in the previous exercise to make Python recognize numbers as text was an example of a function. Python contains a lot of built-in functions that are ready to use. Saving us a lot of manual coding!
# 
# Functions need to be passed one or more parameters as input. The syntax of a function is as follows: *functionname(parameters)*. When there are multiple parameters these are seperated with a comma.
# 
# You can find some examples below.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell
# ```

# In[ ]:


# Calculate the highest number using the max() function.
max(5, 8, 35, 4, 75, 2)


# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Round the number below using the round() function. The first parameter is the number to round. The second number is the required number of decimals. Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell
# ```

# In[ ]:


round(36.53343, 2)


# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Calculate the *lowest* number using the function min(). This functions works similarly to the previously used max() function.
# Use the following numbers: 6, 24, 8, 2, 14. 
# ```
# 
# ### Packages
# 
# The last important thing to know is that Python works with packages. A package is a collection of modules with predefined functions. These functions can than be used in your own code. Using packages can save a lot of programming work and enhances the functionality of base Python. Most Python programmers regularly use packages.
# 
# Before using a Python package it needs to be *installed*. This preferably done using the command line but can also be done within your Jupyter Notebook.
# Afterwards the package needs to be *imported* into the Notebook. After importing the package is ready for use.
# 
# To demonstrate this we will install, import and use a package to display some information about the contents of DHBenelux 2022. 
# 
# First you will need to download the dataset.
# 
# **To Add** download link and dataset
# 
# Now lets install and import the packages we need.
# We will need three packages:
# - Pandas, for easy data manipulation 
# - matplotlib, for plotting in Python
# - WordCloud, for generating a wordcloud 
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell
# ```

# In[ ]:


# Install the package
get_ipython().system('pip install pandas')
get_ipython().system('pip install WordCloud')
get_ipython().system('pip install matplotlib')


# ```{note}
# The exclamation mark before *pip* is needed to activate *pip* within the Notebook enviroment. When installing from the command line this is not needed.
# ```

# In[ ]:


# Import the package
import pandas
import wordcloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# ```{note}
# There is a difference between the import statements of the three packages. In the case of *pandas* and *wordcloud* we import the whole package. 
# For *matplotlib* we only want the *pyplot* module, so we added this explicitly after the package name. This ensures that ony that module is imported. The *as plt* statement renames package to a shorter and easier typable code. You will see this used below.
# ```
# 
# A package can be used in the same way as a function. 
# We will use the *pandas* package to load data into the Notebook in a way that is digestable for the creation of a wordcloud.
# Many packages feature multiple functions for data manipulation, calculation or visualisation. The function you wish to use is added after the package name.
# 
# Syntax: *packagename.function(parameters)*
# 
# The package name points Python to the location of the function. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell
# ```

# In[ ]:


wordcloud_dict = pandas.read_csv( [path_to_file]\wordcloud_dataset.csv, header=None, index_col=0, squeeze=True).to_dict()


# ```{note}
# As you can see, the *pandas* name precedes the option *read_csv*. 
# ```
# 
# Now we have data it is good practice to have a quick look at it to ensure the data is loaded correctly.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the name of the dataset in a cell and run the cell
# ```
# 
# The data should look like the example below.

# In[ ]:


wordcloud_dict


# When the data is correctly loaded we can use the *WordCloud* and *matplotlib* packages to create a wordcloud from the data.
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell
# ```

# In[ ]:


# initialise the wordcloud
wc = WordCloud(background_color="white", max_words=20)
# generate the wordcloud 
wc.generate_from_frequencies(words)
# plt the wordcloud to the output
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(wc,interpolation="bilinear")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


# This should plot a wordcloud showing maximally 20 word in different sizes. Each word is sized by the amount of times it occurs in the titles of the DHBenelux 2022 abstract. Common words have already been removed.
# This visualiation can give quick insight to which items are popular at the moment. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Exercise
# :class: attention
# Which are the three most popular words in the abstract titles? 
# ```
#  
# ```{admonition} Solution
# :class: tip, dropdown
# The three most common words are:
# 1. Data
# 2. Historical
# 3. History
# ```
