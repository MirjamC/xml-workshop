    "# 1. Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "This lesson will give a short introduction on how to work with Notebooks in combination with Python. \n",
    "It consists of explanation followed by pratical exercises. To get the most out of this lesson it is best to manually type the code into your Jupyter Notebook instead of copy-pasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebooks\n",
    "First, lets start up Jupyter and open a Notebook.\n",
    "In the taskbar searchbox, type 'jupyter' and open *jupyter notebook*.\n",
    "This should open a tab in your browser with the jupyter hub in the installation folder. \n",
    "This folder will act as your home folder for jupyter.\n",
    "All Notebooks you make will be stored here unless explicitely saved elsewhere or moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a new Python Jupyter Notebook click the **new** button in the topright corner and select **python3** from the dropdown list.\n",
    "A new tab should open dispaying your new Notebook, usually called *Untitled*\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks can be renamed by clicking on the name and typing a different name. It is best to make these names descriptive so they are still recognizable after a while. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To add:** screenshots \n",
    "\n",
    "## How does a Notebook work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Notebook is not a static page, but an interactive enviroment. Within the blocks (cells) of a Notebook code can be written Ã¡nd executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different cell types\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are compromised of different types of cells. \n",
    "The main cell types are *text cells* and *code cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text cells are generally used for descriptions and explanations. These cells are inactive and code written in these cells cannot be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To add:** screenshot text cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout is managed through *markdown* (see [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second main type of cell is the code cell. \n",
    "Code cells are used to write and execute code. In our case Python. When a code cell is run, Python will execute the code in the cell. More information about Python will follow in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To add:** screenshot code  cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells are easily recognized by the 'In [ ]:' to the left of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of a cell can be changed by selecting a cell and either going through the menu (Cell/Cell Type/<option>) or by selecting a cell and pressing either **Y** for a code cell or **M** for a text cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To add:** printscreen menu celltype\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Select a cell in the Notebook and change the type by using the hotkeys or the menu. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running cells\n",
    "There are multiple ways to run a cell:\n",
    "* By clicking the 'Run' button in the taskbar;\n",
    "* By pressing 'shift + enter when the cell is selected (green frame)'\n",
    "\t*Note that this will add move the selection box down one cell. When the end of the cells is reached this will add new empty cells to the Notebook.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment a cell generates *output* the output is displayed beneath the cell, keeping code and output together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise \n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Type the code below in a cell in your Notebook and run the cell.\n",

    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was developed in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. The purpose of Python was to create a programming language that is both simple to understand and readable. Python works on different platforms such as Windowns, Mac, Linux, etc. It is a very popular programming language in data analysis and data science because of its versatality.\n",
    "Python is open source, and can be used for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Python there are multiple types of input data, such as lists, numbers, text, and even whole tables.\n",
    "We put this input into *variables*. Essentially a container for the data. The name of a variable is up to your own discretion, although there are some [rules and guidlines](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_variable_names.asp). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python remembers which input was loaded into which variable. This means that the variables can be used in the code instead of the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to input data correctly, for numbers *no* quotation marks are used, for text quotation marks *must be* used!\n",
    "\n",
    "The command *type()* can be used to determine what type of input a variable contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "*int* indicates a variable contains an integer, or whole number.\n",
    "*str* indicates a variable contains a string, a piece of text. \n",
