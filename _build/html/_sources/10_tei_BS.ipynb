    "For this session we will extract data from TEI format. We will only extract information from TEI using Beautifull Soup as ElementTree does not handle spaces (&nbsp) well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with TEI format it is very important to check the lay-out. This can vary a lot between files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opletten: teis kunnen erg verschillen van opmaak \n",
    "##(voorbeeld van een TEI waarin de text in een p staat of in een l). \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the example, it is wise to **always** check which elements you need to ensure you extract the correct data. \n",
    "TEI files of the same kind, for example all about one poet, usually are similar. However, double-checking this can save a lot of work (and frustration) later on.\n",
