    "# 7. Practical: Extract information from the Alto/Didle format with ElemenTree\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to extract the plain text and some additional information from an Alto file containing a Dutch newspaper. \n",
    "We assume that you have followed the practical lesson 4. We will reference to corresponding parts of that lesson so you can check how it worked. \n",
    "\n",
    "We follow these steps:\n",
    "- Load the XML file;\n",
    "- Examine the structure of the XML file;\n",
    "- Extract the plain text;\n",
    "- Divide the plain text into seperate articles;\n",
    "- Extract the page number;\n",
    "- Save the content in one file and in seperate textfiles; \n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new Jupyter Notebook and type all code examples and code exercises in your Notebook. \n",
    "(see explantion in {ref}`ET:import`)\n",

    "## Import ElemenTree and import the xml file\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Import the package and load the xml file. \n",

    "\troot = tree.getroot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examine the structure of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can extraxt content from a XML file, you have to see what inside and how it is structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Show the XML file in your Notebook\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this XML file has a lot more elements and attributes than our example file. \n",
    "Our goal is to extraxt the text from the news paper, to seperate the text into articles and to store them on our computer with the page number. \n",
    "\n",
    "So first, lets see if we can see where the textual content of the news paper is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Scroll through the XML file and see if you can find the element in which the text of the newspaper is stored. Hint: one of the news articles mentioned\n",
    "'olifant'. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "If we compare the element 'String' to our example XML, we see that there is a difference in how the content is stored. What is the difference? \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "The content of the elements of the example XML where stored als values from the elements. \n",
    "The content of the String element is stored in an attribute called 'CONTENT'. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "There are a lot of nested element in this XML file. What are the parents, grand parents and grand grandparents of the 'String' element? Are their more parents than this?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "The parent of the 'String' element is 'Textline'\n",
    "The grandparent is 'TextBlock'\n",
    "The grandgrandparent is 'Page'.\n",
    "The complete line is alto/Layout/Page/TextBlock/Textline/String\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we know some first important information about this Alto file, so let's see if we can extract the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extract the plain text\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by extracting all the text, without worrying about the division between the articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "As you have seen, the plain text of the news paper is stored in the 'CONTENT' attribute of the 'String' element. How can you extract the values from attributes?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "This can be done with the .get method, for example: book.get('id'). \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned in lesson 4 that you can acces the elements with a for loop, like\n",
    "```\n",
    "for book in root.findall('book'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, as you have seen above, the element 'String' is a grandgrandgrandgrandchild from the start element 'alto'.\n",
    "One way to access the String element is by typing all ancestors, leading to a code like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for book in root.findall('alto/Layout/Page/TextBlock/Textline/String'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we preferably avoid that, since it takes a lot of time and leads easliy to mistake. \n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "In lesson 4, we learned a way to escapte all the ancestors, how did you do this?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "By adding './/', for example  for book in root.findall(''.//author'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can easily loop through all String elements by using the .// escape, and we can extract the content from the CONTENT attribute with the .get method. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Create the for loop to extract the content. This loop looks like this:\n",
    "    for text in the String elements:\n",
    "\t\tprint(the value of the CONTENT attribute)\n",
    "Complete the code and run it. What happens?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "\tfor book in root.findall('ns0:String'):\n",
    "\t\tprint(book.get('CONTENT'))\n",
    "\n",
    "The code doesn't produce any outcome. \t\t\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is going on? Why isn't there any output?\n",
    "As described in lesson ***2***, some XML documents make use of *namespaces*. \n",
    "If we look at the first line of the Alto file, we see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf8'?>\n",
    "<ns0:alto xmlns:ns0=\"http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line shows us that this XML make use of namespaces. \n",
    "'ns0' is used as a shortcut for 'http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO'. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have now to options to handle the namespaces in ElemenTree:\n",
    "1. Type the namespace before the elementname between curly brackets: {http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for book in root.findall('.//{http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO}String'):\n",
    "    content = book.get('CONTENT')\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Declare the namespace in elemenTree. You therefore provide Python with a dictionary of the used namespaces, which it can use."
