    "```\n",
    "However, as you have seen above, the element 'String' is a grandgrandgrandgrandchild from the start element 'alto'.\n",

    "for page in root_alto.findall('alto/Layout/Page/TextBlock/Textline/String'):\n",

    "for book in root.findall(''.//author'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
