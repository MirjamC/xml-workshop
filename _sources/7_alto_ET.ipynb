    "# 7. Practical: Extract information from the Alto/Didle format with ElemenTree\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to extract the plain text and some additional information from an Alto file containing a Dutch newspaper. \n",
    "We assume that you have followed the practical lesson 4. We will reference corresponding parts of that lesson so you can check how it worked. \n",
    "\n",
    "We follow these steps:\n",
    "- Load the XML file;\n",
    "- Examine the structure of the XML file;\n",
    "- Extract the plain text;\n",
    "- Divide the plain text into seperate articles;\n",
    "- Extract the page number;\n",
    "- Save the content in one file and in seperate textfiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new Jupyter Notebook and type all code examples and code exercises in your Notebook. \n",
    "(see explanation in {ref}`ET:import`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import ElemenTree and import the xml file\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Import the package and load the xml file. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n",
    "\n",
    "\ttree = ET.parse('xml-workshop/data/alto.xml')\n",
    "\troot = tree.getroot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examine the structure of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can extract content from a XML file, you have to see what is inside and how it is structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Show the XML file in your Notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "\tprint(ET.tostring(root, encoding='utf8').decode('utf8'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this XML file has a lot more elements and attributes than our example file. \n",
    "Our goal is to extract the text from the news paper, to seperate the text into articles, and to store them on our computer with the page number. \n",
    "\n",
    "So first, let's see if we can find where the textual content of the news paper is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "Scroll through the XML file and see if you can find the element in which the text of the newspaper is stored. Hint: one of the news articles mentioned\n",
    "'olifant'. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "The content of the news paper articles is stored in the element 'ns0:String'\n",
    "\n",
    "\t<String ID=\"P3_ST00483\" HPOS=\"557\" VPOS=\"3994\" WIDTH=\"109\" HEIGHT=\"26\" CONTENT=\"olifant\" WC=\"0.99\" CC=\"6000010\"/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "If we compare the element 'String' to our example XML, we see that there is a difference in how the content is stored. What is the difference? \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "The content of the elements of the example XML were stored als values from the elements. \n",
    "The content of the String element is stored in an attribute called 'CONTENT'. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "There are a lot of nested element in this XML file. What are the parents, grandparents and grandgrandparents of the 'String' element? Are there even more parents?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "- The parent of the 'String' element is 'Textline'\n",
    "- The grandparent is 'TextBlock'\n",
    "- The grandgrandparent is 'Page'.\n",
    "- The complete line is alto/Layout/Page/TextBlock/Textline/String\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we know some important information about this Alto file, so let's see if we can extract the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extract the plain text\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by extracting all the text, without worrying about the division between the articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "As you have seen, the plain text of the news paper is stored in the 'CONTENT' attribute of the 'String' element. How can you extract the values from attributes?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "This can be done with the .get method, for example: book.get('id'). \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In lesson 4 we learned that is is possible to acces the elements with a for loop, like\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for book in root.findall('book'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, as you have seen above, the element 'String' is a grandgrandgrandgrandchild from the start element 'alto'.\n",
    "One way to access the String element is by typing all ancestors, leading to a code like:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for book in root.findall('alto/Layout/Page/TextBlock/Textline/String'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we preferably avoid that, since it takes a lot of time and can easily lead to mistakes. \n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "In lesson 4, we learned a way to escape all the ancestors, how did we do this?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "By adding './/', for example \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for book in root.findall(''.//author'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can easily loop through all String elements by using the .// escape, and we can extract the content from the CONTENT attribute with the .get method. \n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Exercise\n",
    ":class: attention\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "Create the for loop to extract the content. This loop looks like this:\n",
    "    for text in the String elements:\n",
    "\t\tprint(the value of the CONTENT attribute)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Complete the code and run it. What happens?\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "\tfor book in root.findall('ns0:String'):\n",
    "\t\tprint(book.get('CONTENT'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code doesn't produce any output. \t\t\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is going on? Why is not there any output?\n",
    "As described in lesson ***2***, some XML documents make use of *namespaces*. \n",
    "If we look at the first line of the Alto file, we see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```XML\n",
    "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf8'?>\n",
    "<ns0:alto xmlns:ns0=\"http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line shows us that this XML make use of namespaces. \n",
    "'ns0' is used as a shortcut for 'http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO'. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have now two options to handle the namespaces in ElemenTree:\n",
    "1. Type the namespace before the element name between curly brackets: {http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO}\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for book in root.findall('.//{http://schema.ccs-gmbh.com/ALTO}String'):\n",
    "    content = book.get('CONTENT')\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Declare the namespace in elemenTree. This provides Python with a dictionary of the used namespaces, which it can then use."
